  The collatz conjecture is a conjecture that is based on two simple rules,
starting with a number N:

	 1. if N is even, the next N is N / 2
	 2. if N is odd, the next N is 3N + 1

  The conjecture is that all numbers will go to one. This is one of the
big unsolved problems in mathematics.

  These two small programs are intended to show the collatz conjecture
in two different ways. collatz_tree shows how numbers branch out
following the rule in reverse. collatz_sequence shows how a number goes
down to one.
